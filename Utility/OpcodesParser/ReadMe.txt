Opcodes Parser Utility
======================

This utility creates or update the "opcodes.txt" file.

This file must be included in the sources folder:
/WinXound_Net/Resources/

This file is used internally by WinXound as an Embedded Resource
to create "Opcodes" Hashtable and to create "CSound Repository" database.
