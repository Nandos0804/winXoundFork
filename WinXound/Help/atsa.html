				<h2>Parameters</h2>
				<p>ATS analysis was devised by Juan Pampin. For complete information on ATS visit: <EM>http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~juan/ATS.html</EM>.
				</p>
				<p>Analysis parameters must be carefully tuned for the Analysis Algorithm (ATSA) to 
					properly capture the nature of the signal to be analyzed. As there are a 
					significant number of them, ATSH offers the possibility of Saving/Loading them 
					in a Binary File carrying the extension "*.apf". The extension is not 
					mandatory, but recommended. A brief explanation of each Analysis Parameters 
					follows:
				</p>
				<div class="orderedlist">
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							<p>Start (secs.): the starting time of the analysis in seconds.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Duration (secs.): the duration time of the analysis in seconds. A zero means the 
								whole duration of the input sound file.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Lowest Frequency (Hz.): this parameter will partially determine the size of the 
								Analysis Window to be used. To compute the size of the Analysis Window, the 
								period of the Lowest Frequency in samples (SR / LF) is multiplied by the number 
								of cycles of it the user wants to fit in the Analysis Window (see parameter 6). 
								This value is rounded to the next power of two to determine the size of the FFT 
								for the analysis. The remaining samples are zero-padded. If the signal is a 
								single, harmonic sound, then the value of the Lowest Frequency should be its 
								fundamental frequency or a sub-harmonic of it. If it is not harmonic, then its 
								lowest significant frequency component may be a good starting value.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Highest Frequency (Hz.): highest frequency to be taken into account for Peak 
								Detection. Once it is determined that no relevant information is found beyond a 
								certain frequency, the analysis may be faster and more accurate setting the 
								Highest Frequency parameter to that value.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Frequency Deviation (Ratio): frequency deviation allowed for each peak in the 
								Peak Continuation Algorithm, as a ratio of the frequency involved. For 
								instance, considering a peak at 440 Hz and a Deviation of .1 will produce that 
								the Peak Continuation Algorithm will only try to find candidates for its 
								continuation between 396 and 484 Hz (10% above and below the frequency of the 
								peak). A small value is likely to produce more trajectories whilst a large 
								value will reduce them, but at the cost of rendering information difficult to 
								be further processed.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Number of Cycles of Lowest Frequency to fit in Analysis Window: this will also 
								partially determine the size of the Fourier Analysis Window to be used. See 
								Parameter 3. For single harmonic signals, it is supposed to be more than one 
								(typically 4).</p>
						<li>
							<p>Hop Size (Ratio): size of the gap between one Analysis Window and the next 
								expressed as a ratio of the Window Size. For instance, a Hop Size value of .25 
								will "jump" by 512 samples (Windows will overlap for a 75% of their size). This 
								parameter will also determine the size of the analysis frames obtained. Signals 
								that change their spectra very fast (such as Speech sounds) may need a high 
								frame rate in order to properly track their changes.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Amplitude Threshold (dB): the highest amplitude value to be taken into account 
								for Peak Detection.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Window Type: the shape of the smoothing function to be used for the Fourier 
								Analysis. There are four choices available at present: Blackman, 
								Blackman-Harris, Von Hann, and Hanning. Precise specifications about them are 
								easily found on D.S.P. bibliography.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Track Length (Frames): The Peak Continuation Algorithm will "look-back" by 
								Length frames in order to do its job better, preventing frequency trajectories 
								from curving too much and loosing stability. However, a large value for this 
								parameter will slow down the analysis significantly.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Minimal Segment Length (Frames): once the analysis is done, the spectral data 
								can be further "cleaned" up during post-processing. Trajectories shorter than 
								this value are suppressed if their average SMR is below Minimal Segment SMR 
								(see parameters 16 and 14). This might help to avoid non-relevant sudden 
								changes while keeping a high frame rate, reducing also the number of 
								intermittent sinusoids during synthesis.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Minimal Gap Length (Frames): as parameter 11, this one is also used to clean up 
								the data during post-processing. In this case, gaps (zero amplitude values, 
								i.e. theoretical "silence") longer than Length frames are filled up with 
								amplitude/frequency values obtained by linear interpolation of the adjacent 
								active frames. This parameter prevents sudden interruptions of stable 
								trajectories while keeping a high frame rate.</p>
						<li>
							<p>SMR Threshold (dB SPL): also a post-processing parameter, the SMR Threshold is 
								used to eliminate partials with low averages.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Minimal Segment SMR (dB SPL): this parameter is used in combination with 
								parameter 11. Short segments with SMR average below this value will be removed 
								during post-processing.</p>
						<li>
							<p>Last Peak Contribution (0 to 1): as explained in Parameter 10, the Peak 
								Continuation Algorithm "looks-back" several number of frames to do its job 
								better. This parameter will help to weight the contribution of the first 
								precedent peak over the others. A zero value means that all precedent peaks (to 
								the size of Parameter 10) are equally taken in account.</p>
						<li>
							<p>SMR Contribution (0 to 1): In addition to the proximity in frequency of the 
								peaks, the ATS Peak Continuation Algorithm may use psycho-acoustic information 
								(the Signal-to-Mask-Ratio, or SMR) to improve the perceptual results. This 
								parameter indicates how much the SMR information is used during tracking. For 
								instance, a value of .5 makes the Peak Continuation Algorithm to use a 50% of 
								SMR information and a 50% of Frequency Proximity information to decide which is 
								the best candidate to continue a sinusoidal track.</p>

				<h2>Examples</h2>
				<p>
					The following command:
				</p>
				<pre class="programlisting">
          <span class="emphasis"><em>atsa</em></span> -b0.1 -e1 -l100 -H10000 -w2 audiofile.wav audiofile.ats</pre>
				<p>
					Generates the ATS analysis file 'audiofile.ats' from the original 
					'audiofile.wav' file. It begins analysis from second 0.1 of the file and the 
					analysis is performed for 1 second thereafter. The lowest frequency stored is 
					100 Hz and the highest is 10kHz. A Hamming window is used for each analysis 
					frame.
